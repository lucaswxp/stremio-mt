Metacritic catalog
===

*This addon brings one of the most respected critics aggregators of the world directly to Stremio. You will be able to check critics scores and all "Must See" Movies recommended by Metacritic.*

One of the biggest challenges in today's huge wave of content and movies is making a decision on
what should we watch next!

With this addon you will have Metacritic's public critics score direct into your Stremio catalog:

There is also a "Must See" catalog which makes it easy to decide which movie to watch next:

And, of course, you can also filter by genre like you normally would, but this time movies will be sorted by their rating score:

This addon is compatible with others addons, so you can watch the movies directly from the catalog if you have the correct streaming addons installed.

We all know there are tons of ratings websites out there, like IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes. But just between us, I think they are too soft with their reviews. That's why I like Metacritic better, I almost never disappoint with their reviews.

Enjoy and happy watching!
