Never again watch a boring movie or TV show!

Brings one of the most respected critics aggregators of the world to Stremio. Check critics scores and all "Must See" Movies recommended by Metacritic.

We all know there are tons of ratings websites out there, like IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes. But just between us, I think their are too soft with their reviews. That's why I like Metacritic better.

With this addon you will have Metacritic's public critics score direct into your Stremio catalog, check it out:

There is also a "Must See" catalog which only shows movies above 90 approval rating:

And, of course, you can also filter by genre:

It's also compatible with others addons like the TBT, so you can watch it directly from the catalog!

Enjoy. Happy watching!
