<p align="center">
  <em>Brings one of the most respected critics aggregators of the world directly to Stremio!</em>
</p>

You will be able to check critics scores and all "Must See" Movies recommended by Metacritic. Two new catalogs will be available:

- __Top__ : Latest and finest movies with critics scores information
- __Must See__: Best movies of all times sorted by score

How many times have you found youself in the following situation?

1. Open movie catalog
2. Browse...
3. Browse...
5. Browse...
6. Go to sleep because can't make up your freaking mind!

This addon tries to help users to make an informed decision on what to watch next:

</p>

It's also compatible with others addons, so you can watch the movies directly from the catalog if you have the correct streaming addons installed.

We all know there are tons of ratings websites out there, like IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes. But just between us, I think they are too soft with their reviews. That's why I like Metacritic better, I almost never disappoint with their reviews.

Enjoy and happy watching!
